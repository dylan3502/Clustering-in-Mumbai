    "\n",
    "Since there are lots of restaurants in Mumbai, we will try to detect locations that are not already crowded with restaurants but still have some competition. We would also prefer locations as close to city center as possible, assuming that first two conditions are met.\n",

    "We will use KMeans clustering after the initial cleanign of Data to generate a few most promissing neighbourhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders."
